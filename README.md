4. Testing the application
--- 2 api endpoints are hosted here
    --- http://127.0.0.1:8000/whatsapp_response (use this to test from twilio)
    --- http://127.0.0.1:8000/test (use this to test from swagger)
--- use curl -X POST https://serveo.net -d 'localhost:8000' or ssh -R 80:localhost:8000 serveo.net to tunnel into port 8000 and http traffic will be redirected to another endpoint (for eg: https://a013a3e1dfa69bde357b38ad587fc630.serveo.net)


--- In your Twilio Console, go to the WhatsApp Sandbox settings and set the webhook URL to your serverâ€™s endpoint https://a013a3e1dfa69bde357b38ad587fc630.serveo.net
/whatsapp_response
